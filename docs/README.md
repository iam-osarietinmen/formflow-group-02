# FormFlow - Dockerized 3-Tier Application with CI/CD Pipeline

> A production-ready demonstration of a Dockerized three-tier application with automated Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using GitHub Actions, Docker Hub, and a Linux Virtual Machine.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

FormFlow is a cloud-native web application deployed using a modern DevOps workflow. The project demonstrates how a three-tier application can be containerized, versioned, automatically built, deployed, and rolled back using industry-standard DevOps tools and best practices.

The project was completed as part of the **Cloud & DevOps Bootcamp Capstone Project**, with emphasis on infrastructure design, automation, deployment consistency, version traceability, and disaster recovery.

Rather than manually copying files to servers, every deployment is fully automated through GitHub Actions, ensuring consistency, repeatability, and reliability.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project were to:

- Containerize a three-tier web application.
- Separate the application into Frontend, Backend, and Database services.
- Automate image builds using Docker.
- Push versioned images to Docker Hub.
- Implement a complete CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
- Deploy automatically to a Linux Virtual Machine.
- Implement Semantic Versioning for image management.
- Support quick rollback to previous stable versions.
- Secure sensitive credentials using GitHub Secrets.
- Document the complete deployment process.

The application follows a **3-tier architecture**, where each component performs a dedicated responsibility:

| Tier     | Responsibility          |
| -------- | ----------------------- |
| Frontend | User Interface          |
| Backend  | Business Logic & API    |
| Database | Persistent Data Storage |

# 🔄 CI/CD Workflow

Running Containers
```

Every successful push triggers the GitHub Actions workflow, which automatically:

1. Builds the Docker images.
2. Tags the images using Semantic Versioning.
3. Pushes the images to Docker Hub.
4. Connects securely to the Linux VM via SSH.
5. Pulls the latest versioned images.
6. Restarts the application containers.
7. Verifies that deployment completed successfully.

---

# 🏷 Image Versioning Strategy

This project does **not** rely on the `latest` Docker tag.

Instead, every deployment is assigned a Semantic Version such as:

```
v1.0.0
v1.0.1
v1.1.0
v2.0.0
```

This approach provides:

- Complete deployment traceability
- Easy rollback
- Predictable deployments
- Production version visibility

---

# 🔐 Secrets Management

Sensitive credentials are never committed to Git.

Secrets are securely stored using GitHub Secrets and environment variables.

Examples include:

- Docker Hub Token
- Docker Hub Username
- SSH Private Key
- VM Host
- Database Password
- API Keys

---

# 🔄 Rollback Strategy

If a deployment introduces issues, the system can quickly revert to the previous stable image.

Rollback process:

1. Identify the previous image version.
2. Pull the tagged image.
3. Update deployment configuration.
4. Restart containers.
5. Verify application health.

This minimizes downtime and ensures service continuity.
